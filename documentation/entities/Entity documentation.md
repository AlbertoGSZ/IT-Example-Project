# IT-Example-Proyect || Entity relationships


### **Relationships**

Two entities are found, to be called "Person" and "CaseReport".

The entity Person has reflexive relationship because it obeys a structure
of a tree similar to the genealogical one, in which one figure leaves several in branched structure.
Each person can have a boss or not as well as a list of people under his command (if any).
In the same way, the ¨Person¨ entity will have a list of ¨CaseReport¨ objects that will be the criminal history.


### **Entity info: Person**

- Name: String.
- Surname: String.
- BirthDate: Object Date (). Requirement date before the present day (have to consider the limits).
- Adress: String.  
- Nationality: ENUM.
- Sex: ENUM.
- ID: Integer. Non-repeatable random generation.
- Alias: String.
- FelonyRecordsDigital: ¨CaseReport¨ objects list.
- Rank: Integer.
- Chief: "Person" object.
- Subordinates: "Person" objects list.

Because of logic reasons, I only wanted to designate the presence of a crime as necessary to create a Person object since in many cases not few data will be missing, but we will only have a crime that has drawn attention and the need to create a criminal record, without achieving to know even the sex of the criminal.

For the same reason I didn´t want to get deeper into certain aspects such as the structural configuration of the DNI (different in each country if there is one), the residence (sometimes you can have an exact location, coordinates of an unnamed site or a general site...), so if I usually lack details that allow me to configure the creation of the object, I prefer to sin cautiously and not delimiting supported by personal assumptions.


### **Entity info: CaseReport**

- ID: Integer. Non-repeatable random generation.
- Date: Date Object. Final date, creation date of the CaseReport.
- Mugshot: Image object.
- PersonDetails: String. Not empty.  
- EventDescription: String. Not empty.
- EvidencePhotos: String list.
- FelonyRecordPDF: String list.
